# Fencing virtual leaderboard

This is the source code for a responsive web application as a virtual leaderboard for Apex Fencing Academy to keep records of their fencersâ€™
tournament results and highlight their top fencers, using Flask (Python) and MySQL. 
The tournament result submission form is user-friendly and accessible for fencers of all ages to input their tournament results.

## Technical structure:
The website is built using the Flask microframework and MySQL database for the backend, and simple HTML/CSS (Bootstrap) for the frontend. 
The Flask routings are available in `app.py`, while all the helper functions that deal with the database are in `funcs.py`.
The folder `templates` consists of all the html templates for the website pages, while `static` contains the styling in CSS as well as
`mobile-style.css` to make the website responsive. `db_making` contains the `sql` query ran to create the database.
